# Today's interview

### First of all
I'd like to thank to Arkadiusz and Filip for a very nice atmosphere during the interview!
Maybe it will sound a little weird, but I really appreciate, we have stayed formal. This is much more comfortable 
for an examined as it keeps symmetrical distance. I believe we will have an opportunity to become colleges.
Moreover, it is very kind, when interviewer answers the question or explain it shortly once he/she is not 100% happy 
of the answer. 
Great, thank of very well provided interview.
