# Today's interview

### First of all
I'd like to thank to Arkadiusz and Filip for a very nice atmosphere during the interview!
Maybe it will sound a little weird, but I really appreciate, we have stayed formal. This is much more comfortable 
for an examined as it keeps symmetrical distance. I believe we will have an opportunity to become colleges.
Moreover, it is very kind, when interviewer answers the question or explain it shortly once he/she is not 100% happy 
of the answer. 
Great, thank for very well provided interview.


#### ABBA
Filip asked me, how to swap 2 numbers (e.g ```int```) without using additional auxiliary variable.
I was thinking about playing with sum, to not lose an information. And that was pretty close, that you said OK.
After I had come home I have found solution :

Imagine we have two numbers **A** and **B**, and no more memory space for auxiliary variable. 
In describition below A,B stays for values, while order defines variable 1 or 2.

We start then with :
```A , B```
in memory. 

In next step at first position I write sum of two variables, keeping B unchanged.

``` A+B, B```

This is one step operation, and no information is lost. Moreover, I have choosen sum, as it is symetrical : A+B = B+A.

In a second step I will keep 1<sup>st</sup> variable unchanged while as a second one I put `var_1 - var_2`.

```A+B, A```

Finally, I substract scond variable from a first one :

```B, A```

In summary:

```A,B -> A+B, B -> A+B, A -> B, A ```

That's it. I called it ABBA as A,B -> B,A. I haven't searched on the web yet - I swear.

Filip, you have asked that further one could ask what would happen if we reach MAX of int (as in this example).
To unsware it, it is worth to know, how integers are coded, kept in Java.
